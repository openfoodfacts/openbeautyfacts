## What is Open Beauty Facts ##

### A cosmetic products database

Open Beauty Facts is a database of cosmetic products with ingredients, allergens… and all the tidbits of information we can find on product labels. 

### Made by everyone

Open Beauty Facts is a non-profit association of volunteers.
4800+ contributors like you have added 100 000+ products from 170 countries using our Android, iPhone or Windows Phone app or their camera to scan barcodes and upload pictures of products and their labels.

### For everyone

Data about cosmetics is of public interest and has to be open. The complete database is published as open data and can be reused by anyone and for any use. Check-out the cool reuses or make your own!
